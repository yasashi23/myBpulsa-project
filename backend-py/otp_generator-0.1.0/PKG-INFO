Description: # OTP Generator
        
        **A Python tool to generate and verify One Time Password (OTP)**
        
        This tool is designed to enable developers generate and verify OTP using Python [cyrptophy](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/) package.
        
        
        An OtpServer class provides basic operations for generating and verifying OTP. 
        There is no database support provided for saving to a given database rather hooks are provided as functions. 
        The function hooks take two parameters: a callable and a data. 
        The callable is any class, method, or function which should be executed when an event occurs. 
        The data parameter is used to pass any set of information or data to the callable during execution.
        
        The hooks simply perform a function call without any data processing or checks. 
        **Developers are expected to perform necessary modifications to make this tool fit their designed system(s).** 
        
        
        ## Motivation
        
        The OTP generator was developed as a means of authenticating user's email, mobile or identity. 
        
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        This application depends on `cryptography` package. The target Python for current implementation is Python 3.8
        
        ## Build Status
        
        **Version: 0.1.0**
        
        Current development of `otp_generator` is version 0.1.0. This is considered the Alpha Edition.
        
        ## Features
        
        Current build features include:
        
        + Generate OTP with corresponding data for later verification of the generated code
        + Verify OTP code using stored data that does not identify the generated OTP code.
        
        It is assumed that all data generated for a given OTP code are securely saved. 
        Developers are to ensure storage and retrieval of data. Various function hooks are provided to this end. 
        
        
        ## Contributing
